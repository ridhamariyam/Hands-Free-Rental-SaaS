## 📌 Overview
This project is an experimental **SaaS app for property rentals**, built with the help of an AI agent.  
The idea is to simplify rental management by letting **tenants handle everything** (visits, payments, maintenance requests) directly in the app.  
Landlords receive reports and escalations, while security staff and service vendors (gas, internet, cleaning, etc.) also have roles in the system.

## ⚠️ Status
This is still a **Work in Progress (WIP)**. Features, APIs, and structures may change as development continues.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (planned)
- Backend: Django + Django REST Framework + PostgreSQL  
- Frontend: React (web) + React Native (mobile)  
- Auth: JWT 
- Payments
- Notifications

## 🎯 MVP Goals
- Tenant signup/login with KYC  
- Property & unit management by landlords  
- Visit booking with OTP verification  
- Rent/payment tracking  
- Maintenance ticketing with vendor assignment
